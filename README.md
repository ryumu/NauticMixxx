## A clear view of your set

![NauticMixxx 2.0 PERFORMANCE view with both decks idle](branding/readme/performance-2.0.png)

<sub>PERFORMANCE · macOS capture of the 2.0 interface, with both decks idle.</sub>

## New in 2.0

**Your controls, together.** UTILITY brings deck, mixer, effects, browser, recording and display settings into one encoder-friendly menu. SHORTCUT keeps frequent adjustments close at hand.

**Effects with intent.** Four persistent Beat FX favorites, a contextual momentary X-PAD and refined beat/pitch selection. SLIP and active-loop Hot Cue behavior keep performance actions connected to the transport.

**Preparation that travels.** SOURCE MY SETTINGS, USB appearance preferences and explicit cue, loop, beatgrid, playlist and history saves. USB identity checks, atomic writes and recovery copies protect supported edits.

**Playback that stays aware.** Precise imported constant-tempo grids, persistent controller SYNC and cached emergency playback when a playing USB source disappears.

## Plug into your workflow

Prepare and export your USB in rekordbox, open NauticMixxx, then browse and load from SOURCE. The app reads exported USB libraries; its local-folder scanner is disabled.

The dedicated **Hercules DJControl Inpulse 500** mapping is joined by RX3 presets for **DDJ-FLX4, DDJ-400, DDJ-SX / SX2 / SX3, DDJ-WeGO3 and Roland DJ-505**. DDJ-FLX6 has an optional browser-only adapter. Read the [controller guide](docs/CONTROLLERS-RX3-1.5-EN.md) for each mapping's scope.

Physical controller and RX3 audio calibration remain pending. Link Export, registered MATCHING pairs and the complete RX3 effect catalogs are unfinished; the [workflow guide](docs/RX3-WORKFLOW-2.0-EN.md) records the current scope.

## Open source, verifiable releases
